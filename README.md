# 🏪 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on spending behavior. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing and business strategies.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and scales numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes customer distributions and spending patterns.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups customers based on similarity.
- **Elbow Method & Silhouette Score**: Determines the optimal number of clusters.
- **Visualization**: Plots customer clusters in 2D & 3D.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains customer demographics and spending behavior:
- **CustomerID** (Unique ID)
- **Gender** (Male/Female)
- **Age** (Customer's Age)
- **Annual Income (k$)** (Estimated income)
